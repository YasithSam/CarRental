            </h4>
        </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
            At HireMe, you can view and obtain copies of your past rental invoices up to six months from the return of your rental by logging in to your HireME account. For recent returns, please allow up to 3 business days from the date of vehicle return for a copy of the rental receipt to be available. If you require a copy of an invoice older than 6 months, then you may send an email to customerservicehireme@hireme.com to request a copy from our Customer Service specialists.

            </h4>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
            If you did not receive the full amount of the security hold, then your rental price did not cover all charges incurred during your rental. When you return your vehicle, a final audit will be conducted to determine whether there are additional charges that were not paid as part of the rental price. An example of such charges may include fuel replacement, a late return (beyond our 30-minute grace period), and/or a special cleaning. In this case, the returned amount of the security hold will be less.

Just as renters are assessed a fee for cleaning the car's interior for excessive stains, dirt or soiling attributable to the renter’s use, customers will be assessed an additional charge if the car smells of smoke when it is returned.
